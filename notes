When using velocity, it clicks on "next stream" (in ogg_stream::stream()) But
this isn't due to a delay in adding new stream (tried ignoring ov_read and
    alBufferData after a queue of 10 had been filled) - the problem seems to be
as it goes from playing one buffer to the next. Perhaps it changes speed, or
the speed it is playing leads it to jump to the end of the buffer, but not
straight into the next one?

Fixed bug - wasn't passing ogg stream by reference!!

Fixed selection bug - was changing projection matrix back again in display! Now check render mode first!

Working on scratch effects - see keyboard() and ogg_stream::tell etc.

To make playlist:
Get all the names of your ogg files:
% find ~/ogg -name *.ogg > playlist
Extract the titles:
% perl -pi -e 'print;s#.*/(.*)\..*#$1#' playlist

Format:
<file>
<title>

Stopped soundmanager using capture so you can broadcast using shoutcast! (Unmute mic, set capture to MIX, and shoutcastplaylist to DSP:/dev/audio and it works!)

Working on enqueue (double click)
